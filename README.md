## WebTechHandin
First task that needs to be handed in to one of my courses

## Techs used

This page makes use of html (duh), css (also duh) and js / jquery

## Copyright

The images used were all created by me
Some of the assets used in the creation of the images are owned by Riot Games. <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/legal">Here is their legal "Jibber Jabber" which basically says all non-commercial use is fine and dandy.</a>

## Content & functionality

- The entire site is responsive, top to bottom. Notable difference are text-boundaries and image sizes to fit the new screen, + the menu will collapse when switched to mobile

- Clicking on the menu icon expands / collapses the menu

- Hovering over the Logo in the top left will make it spin

- hovering over an image on the frontpage will zoom in and create a box-shadow

- Gallery images will do a slight turn and zoom in on hover. Clicking them will also give an enlarged view which can be closed by either clicking the X in the upper right corner or the ESC key

- The videos are all mine and embedded iframes (I do not have the originals anymore, has been a few years)

- On the about page is a table with a CV, or at least something close

- There is actually a minigame where you can click on an individual cell to color it orange. Click again to remove the color. Alternatively, ESC removes ALL colored cells

## Print

It exists and removes a lot of unneeded content for print views like the navigation / footer and changes up the size / layout a bit, although there are apparently some bugs with flexbox / overflow that cause cutoffs for sites.

## Upload

Die Seite sollte eigentlich zum Hochschulserver aber wie besprochen vermerke ich hier dass das nicht funktioniert wie es soll (kein externer Zugriff)

Das Projekt selbst ist dennoch dort hochgeladen (synced via GitHub),
[der Link zum Repo befindet sich hier](https://github.com/MarvinFlint/WebTechHandin) und der Link zu meinem eigenen Webserver [hier](https://www.deploy.flintsworld.de/)

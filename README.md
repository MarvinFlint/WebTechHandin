## WebTechHandin
First task that needs to be handed in to one of my courses

## Techs used

This page makes use of html (duh), css (also duh) and js / jquery

## Copyright

The images used were all created by me
Some of the assets used in the creation of the images are owned by Riot Games. <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/legal">Here is their legal "Jibber Jabber" which basically says all non-commercial use is fine and dandy.

## Content & functionality

- The entire site is responsive, top to bottom. Notable difference are text-boundaries and image sizes to fit the new screen, + the menu will collapse when switched to mobile

- Clicking on the menu icon expands / collapses the menu

- Hovering over the Logo in the top left will make it spin

- hovering over an image on the frontpage will zoom in and create a box-shadow

- Gallery images will do a slight turn and zoom in on hover. Clicking them will also give an enlarged view which can be closed by either clicking the X in the upper right corner or the ESC key

- The videos are all mine and embedded iframes (I do not have the originals anymore, has been a few years)

- On the about page is a table with a CV, or at least something close

- There is actually a minigame where you can click on an individual cell to color it orange. Click again to remove the color. Alternatively, ESC removes ALL colored cells

## Print

It exists and removes a lot of unneeded content for print views like the navigation / footer and changes up the size / layout a bit, although there are apparently some bugs with flexbox / overflow that cause cutoffs for sites.
